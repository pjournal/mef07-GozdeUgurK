    "text": "1.6 Hypothesis Testing in R Programming\nhypothesis is made by the researchers about the data collected for any experiment or data set. A hypothesis is an assumption made by the researchers that are not mandatory true. In simple words, a hypothesis is a decision taken by the researchers based on the data of the population collected. Hypothesis Testing in R Programming is a process of testing the hypothesis made by the researcher or to validate the hypothesis. To perform hypothesis testing, a random sample of data from the population is taken and testing is performed. Based on the results of the testing, the hypothesis is either selected or rejected. This concept is known as Statistical Inference. In this article, we’ll discuss the four-step process of hypothesis testing, One sample T-Testing, Two-sample T-Testing, Directional Hypothesis, one sample -test, two samples -test and correlation test in R programming.\n\n1.6.0.1 One Sample T-Testing\nOne sample T-Testing approach collects a huge amount of data and tests it on random samples. To perform T-Test in R, normally distributed data is required. This test is used to test the mean of the sample with the population. For example, the height of persons living in an area is different or identical to other persons living in other areas.\n\nSyntax: t.test(x, mu) Parameters: x: represents numeric vector of data mu: represents true value of the mean\n\nTo know about more optional parameters of t.test(), try the below command:\nhelp(\"t.test\")\nExample: \n\n# Defining sample vector\nx &lt;- rnorm(100)\n\n# One Sample T-Test\nt.test(x, mu = 5)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  x\nt = -49.044, df = 99, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.2021081  0.2024591\nsample estimates:\n   mean of x \n0.0001755108"
